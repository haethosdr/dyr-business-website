I was unaware of the accumulation of dirt on my windows and the dust on my screens. It elevated the concept of Spring Cleaning to a whole new level. I highly recommend their services, and you won't be disappointed! Additionally, Dylan & Co. are the sweetest!"  ”</span>

               <span>“  First off I have a ton of windows and even more solar panels. I don’t usually wash my panels but there was a large fire close the day before Rodgers were to arrive. There was soot everywhere on my window sills and the solar panels were thick with it. Rodgers did a great job! Windows are sparkling inside and out including the screens. Trust me there was no shine on my panels this picture was taken through the windows. This is the 2nd time I have used Rodgers but the first for inside and the panels. I will not hire anyone else  ”</span>

               <span>“  We hired Roger’s Windows and Gutters to power wash our house, clean windows and gutters. Could not be happier with results. House looked amazing… windows, inside and out looked fantastic. Never realized how much dirt on windows inside and out build up. Gutters were cleared out too. Very happy with service and will use them again. Very professional and courteous. Thank you Roger’s Windows for an excellent customer experience  ”</span>

He even spent extra time to make sure additional details were cared for that he hadn't included in his estimate. Dylan went above and beyond to make sure we were happy with his work and we appreciate him and his excellent customer service. We'll definitely be working with him again. Delighted to recommend Rogers Windows and Gutters to you here.  ”</span>
